### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Howard Li 

From Shanghai, China, I am currently a student at Bowdoin College majored in Mathematics and Economics. 

For the past two years, I have been an investor and media influencer in the world of crypto and NFTs. I had experience working with top crypto exchanges, VCs, large investment funds, and have led one of the largest Asian Blue-chip NFT communities.

Now, I am transitioning into the tech field with a focus in Machine Learning and Quantitative Finance. You can find some of my work here.
