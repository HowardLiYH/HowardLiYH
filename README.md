### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Howard Li 

From Shanghai, China, I am currently a student at Bowdoin College majored in Mathematics and Economics. 

For the past two years, I have been an investor and media influencer in the world of crypto and NFTs. I had experience working with top crypto exchanges, VCs, and the largest investment DAO. Currently, I lead one of the largest Asian Blue-chip NFT communities with 500 members on WeChat, over 4000 on Discord, and over 40K on Twitter.

Now, I am transitioning into the tech field with an aim of going to MFE program after graduating college. You can find some of my work here.
