My name is Howard Li 

From Shanghai, China, I am currently a student at Bowdoin College majoring in Mathematics and Economics. 

For the past two years, I have been an investor and media influencer in the world of crypto and NFTs. I have experience working with top crypto exchanges, VCs, and large investment funds, and have led one of the largest Asian Blue-chip NFT communities. Now I am on the journey of learning Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Stay tuned for my endless adventures!
